# WinterX//SummerX

Case files for my design of slime trackers.

Hello! I can see you've peaked into the secret branch. Not much is changed, only a couple new files uploaded... ;P

The case files are as listed,

Uni - Universal Case for use of 6050, 6500, 9250, or BMI160. NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU PLAN ON SWAPPING IMUS INTERCHANGABLY.

WinterX 1.0 - The original case.

WinterX 1.2 - A New beta version of case, with better lid design.

WinterX 2.0 - Newest Version of case! Smaller, and all friction fit. Fixed MANY issues. Lid is also extremely improved.

SummerX - NEW CASE DESIGN! This case is a taller, but much more compact case design, similar to others like the hexaeder, battery is on bottom, removable tray.

THE WINTERX AND SUMMERX CASES HAVE SEPERATED FILES, LABELED ACCORDINGLY!

Xtension Public = The extension for the bmi.


OLD VERSIONS WILL NOT BE SEPERATED UNLESS REQUESTED! They take too much space, and since they are outdated, I dont see it as necassary.
