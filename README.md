Case files for my design of slime trackers.

Hello! 

The case files are as listed,

Uni = Universal Case for use of 6050, 6500, 9250, or BMI160. NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU PLAN ON SWAPPING IMUS INTERCHANGABLY.

WinterX Public = The normal case and lid.

Xtension Public = The extension for the bmi.

WinterXNewLid = A New beta version of case, with better lid design. ANY ISSUES MESSAGE ME ON DISCORD (Lixulia#2022)

I have also added the normal case lid and base seperate, for those with smaller printers.
